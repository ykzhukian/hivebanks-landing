      <h2 class="section-header section-header--intro" id="why-we-need">Why do we need digital assets bank</h2>
      <p class="intro-content">
        With the advancement of the Internet and digitization process, people will have more and more valuable digital assets, among which the digital currency is the main form.

        Due to the high technical threshold of digital currency management, ordinary people are not professional and inconvenient to keep digital currency, and are easily lost or stolen by hackers.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Bitcoin, the mainstream digital currency, is limited in blockchain size, and transaction transfer confirmation time is long and the fee is high.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Digital asset bank internal transfer can accelerate the circulation of digital currency outside the digital currency block chain, and it is more convenient for users to confirm the entity qualifications of both parties through information such as identity authentication.

      <p class="intro-content">
        The main difference from digital currency exchanges is that digital asset banks do not have the concept of placing orders. Users cannot set a certain price to sell or buy a certain digital currency.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Like ordinary banks that can exchange currency, users can use the CNY to exchange dollars in banks or convert them into CNY.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Because it is impossible to set up fixed-price buy orders and sell orders, people will not call foreign currency exchange banks foreign currency exchanges.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        In addition, although people can convert legal currency into digital currency through digital assets bank, or convert digital currency into legal currency.

      <p class="intro-content">
        Therefore, digital asset banks may also charge users for the storage of digital assets, and general digital currency exchanges will not charge such fees.
      </p>
      <p class="intro-content">
        Digital banks do not provide futures or leverage like digital currency exchanges, and are more suitable for conservative investors.
